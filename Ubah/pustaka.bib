    abstract = "{In the past two decades, the world has seen three coronaviruses emerge and cause outbreaks that have caused considerable global health consternation. Coronaviruses are enveloped, nonsegmented, single-stranded, positive-sense RNA viruses that have a characteristic appearance on electron microscopy negative staining Image 1. As a matter of fact, the characteristic electron microscopy appearance was the clue to amplify and sequence nucleic acids from Dr Urbani’s (one of the health care providers who died of severe acute respiratory syndrome [SARS] in 2003) respiratory specimen using a consensus coronavirus primer.1 The sequence of the virus was significantly different from other coronaviruses known to cause human disease at the time. The virus was ultimately named SARS-CoV, as febrile patients had severe acute respiratory syndrome and could present with pneumonia and lower respiratory symptoms such as cough and dyspnea.2 The SARS-CoV outbreak started in Guangdong, China, and spread to many countries in Southeast Asia, North America, Europe, and South Africa. Transmission was primarily person to person through droplets that occurred during coughing or sneezing, through personal contact (shaking hands), or by touching contaminated surfaces. Of note, health professionals were particularly at risk of acquiring the disease, as transmission also occurred if isolation precautions were not followed and during certain procedures. The last case of SARS-CoV occurred in September 2003, after having infected over 8,000 persons and causing 774 deaths with a case fatality rate calculated at 9.5\\%.}",

  abstract = {The COVID-19 pandemic has had a substantial impact on the airline industry. Air travel in the United States declined in 2020 with significantly lower domestic and international flights. The dynamic change and uncertainty in the trend of COVID-19 have made it difficult to predict future air travel. This paper aims at developing and testing neural network models that predict domestic and international air travel in the medium and long term based on residents' daily trips by distance, economic condition, COVID-19 severity, and travel restrictions. Data in the United States from various sources were used to train and validate the neural network models, and Monte Carlo simulations were constructed to predict air travel under uncertainty of the pandemic and economic growth. The results show that weekly economic index (WEI) is the most important predictor for air travel. Additionally, daily trips by distance play a more important role in the prediction of domestic air travel than the international one, while travel restrictions seem to have an impact on both. Sensitivity analysis results for four different scenarios indicate that air travel in the future is more sensitive to the change in WEI than the changes in COVID-19 variables. Additionally, even in the best-case scenario, when the pandemic is over and the economy is back to normal, it still takes several years for air travel to return to normal, as before the pandemic. The findings have significant contributions to the literature in COVID-19's impact on air transportation and air travel prediction.}

abstract = {In this study, we use Global Sensitivity Analysis (GSA) to rank four non-pharmaceutical interventions (NPIs) in a deterministic compartmental model that might control Covid-19 related deaths in the United States. The NPIs are social distancing, isolation of infected individuals, identifying asymptomatically infected individuals through testing, and the use of face masks. The model uses a fear-based behavioral model that leads unmasked susceptible individuals to wear masks. The model parameters are estimated from the reported deaths for the United States of America from March 1, 2020 to November 26, 2020. Two GSA tools, the Sobol’ sesntivity indices and Partial Rank Correlation Coefficient are used to obtain the rankings of the input parameters at different stages of the disease propagation. We found that social distancing and outward mask efficiency alone decreases the output uncertainty by 25–45%. Sobol’ second order indices show that the combined effect of social distancing with increased mask usage and identifying and isolating asymptomatically infected individuals decreases uncertainty an additional 10%.}

abstract = {Governments worldwide have rapidly deployed non-pharmaceutical interventions (NPIs) to mitigate the COVID-19 pandemic. However, the effect of these individual NPI measures across space and time has yet to be sufficiently assessed, especially with the increase of policy fatigue and the urge for NPI relaxation in the vaccination era. Using the decay ratio in the suppression of COVID-19 infections and multi-source big data, we investigated the changing performance of different NPIs across waves from global and regional levels (in 133 countries) to national and subnational (in the United States of America [USA]) scales before the implementation of mass vaccination. The synergistic effectiveness of all NPIs for reducing COVID-19 infections declined along waves, from 95.4% in the first wave to 56.0% in the third wave recently at the global level and similarly from 83.3% to 58.7% at the USA national level, while it had fluctuating performance across waves on regional and subnational scales. Regardless of geographical scale, gathering restrictions and facial coverings played significant roles in epidemic mitigation before the vaccine rollout. Our findings have important implications for continued tailoring and implementation of NPI strategies, together with vaccination, to mitigate future COVID-19 waves, caused by new variants, and other emerging respiratory infectious diseases.}

abstract = {The sudden COVID-19 caused frequent incidents of large-scale material panic buying, resulting in imbalance in supply and demand of goods and threatening social stability. It is of great significance to analyze the formation of group panic buying and help alleviate such action. This paper takes the panic buying phenomenon as the research target, quantifies the internal and external factors affecting individual buying behavior, restores the selection process of individual buying behavior, and constructs the emergence model of group panic buying behavior by using the idea of cluster dynamics. Through simulations, we find that: (1) The epidemic information intensity has a significant impact on the emergence of group rush buying behavior. (2) Government intervention plays a significant role in reducing the scale of group rush buying. Besides, the effects of intervention reach the best before people who do not participate in rush buying disappear. In addition, we also discuss the impact, limitations and future research directions.}

To analyze poverty and food security in Myanmar during 2020 we surveyed over 2000 households per month from June–December in urban Yangon and the rural dry zone. By June, households had suffered dramatic increases in poverty, but even steeper increases accompanied the rise in COVID-19 cases from September onwards. Increases in poverty were much larger in urban areas, although poverty was always more prevalent in the rural sample. However, urban households were twice as likely to report food insecurity experiences, suggesting rural populations felt less food insecure throughout the crisis.}

COVID-19 survivors were invited to participate. The authors measured perceived discrimination related to COVID-19 (COVID-19 Perceived Stigma Scale), depression (PHQ-9), insomnia (Athens Insomnia Scale), and post-traumatic stress (Brief Davidson Trauma Scale). Three hundred thirty COVID-19 survivors participated in the research; the participants were between 18 and 89 years; 61.52% were females. 32.12% of the participants reported high perceived discrimination; 49.70%, depression; 60.61%, insomnia; and 13.33% post-traumatic stress. After adjusting for age, gender, and income, depression, insomnia, and post-traumatic stress were associated significantly with discrimination perceived by COVID-19. Perceived discrimination is a social stressor that affects the psychological well-being of people recovered from COVID-19. In the follow-up of this group of patients, it is important to consider the impact of perceived discrimination on psychological well-being.}

We show that irrespective of the different phases of the COVID-19 outbreak, South Africa ranked first as the country with the highest incidence of COVID-19 in Africa both in terms of number of confirmed cases and deaths. However, while Morocco and Tunisia ranked second and third in terms of the number of COVID-19 cases, it was Egypt that ranked second in terms of the number COVID-19 deaths. Employing a PMG –based panel–ARDL model, we offer evidence –based insights on the dynamic of stock markets during COVID-19. We show that number of confirmed cases rather than number deaths tend to be responsible for the declining stock returns in Africa during the pandemic phase of the COVID-19 outbreak. Whereas, the evidence of declining stock returns during the epidemic phase of the COVID-19 appears to be mainly attributable to changes in the international oil prices and exchange rates, respectively. That said the effectiveness or otherwise of efforts at minimizing negative reaction of stock returns to COVID-19 cannot be in isolation of whether the emphasis is on the number of confirmed cases and/or the number of confirmed deaths.}

Through the empirical analysis, it is found that the epidemic has no significant impact on the return of the stock and bond markets, but it has increased the market volatility and the impact on the stock market volatility is gradual and more obvious. There are significant differences in the significance, direction and duration of the epidemic on different sectors. In addition, the impact of COVID-19 has been gradual in some industries and rapid in others. Different industries show different sensitivities in their response to COVID-19. Based on the analysis of the impact, this paper put forward the corresponding suggestions for investment strategies and macro-control decisions.}
